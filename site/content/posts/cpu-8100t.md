CPU benchmark from Dell Optiplex 3060 micro i3-8100T
```bash
$ sysbench cpu run --time=5
sysbench 1.0.20 (using system LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3)

Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1
Initializing random number generator from current time


Prime numbers limit: 10000

Initializing worker threads...
